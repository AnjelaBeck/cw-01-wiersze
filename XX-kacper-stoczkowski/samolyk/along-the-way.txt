Along The Way

When you say no
I gentle grin
When you say no
I say you will
You have to tell me about your life
How to turn from wrong to right
Tell me ?cause I?ll never know

Tell me about it

When I say start - this time of day
And you say go ? return back home
You have to tell me about your life
How to turn from wrong to right
Tell me ?cause I?ll never know

Tell me about it
