Back when I was nearly blameless and could visit the zoo
             and admire the tigers not for what they actually were,
but as monstrous man-eaters that deserved to be caught.
             Back when I thought I had already tasted life's worst 
disappointment, because I'd fallen in love right after college
             and it hadn't worked out. Back when every attractive man—
gay or straight, it didn't matter yet—getting off the bus
             caught my eye, I was a Republican. And I went to work
in Washington D.C., and met all the suited villains
             I'd been warned about. Still reading about Goldwater's
conscience. Thrilled by the idea of bombs. Strangling
             themselves in Limbaugh's neckties. Certain our own
country needed to stage a coup. (Clinton in the White House
             doing what Clinton did.) One day, I set off to buy
a thousand dollars worth of stamps. The stuffing
             of envelopes would soon follow. The best way to get
money is to send a letter and ask for it, they said. Halfway
             to the post office, a breathless boy chased me down. 
Red-faced. Panicked. His dizzying tie swung over his shoulder.
             He told me what my boss had forgotten to say. We can't 
use stamps with women or black people on them. The world
             toppled me that day in a business park—so young
and dumb—I left in an instant to become who I really am.
